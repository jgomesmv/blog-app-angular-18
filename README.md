# BlogApp

- This project is a modern blogging application built using Angular v18 and styled with SCSS. It allows users to view, sort, and interact with blog posts and comments in an intuitive UI.
- It uses the dummyjson api. More info check [dummyjson posts api docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs/posts) page.

## Features

- **Post List**: View a list of blog posts with sorting and pagination.
- **Post Detail View**: Display detailed information about a specific post.
- **Post Detail Comment**: View comments for each post styled as a card list.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
